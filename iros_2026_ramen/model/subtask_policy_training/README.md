# Subtask Policy Training

This folder contains lightweight wrappers for training LeRobot policies on Team RAMEN IROS 2026 subtask datasets uploaded to Hugging Face.

The default config trains `pick_leg`, but the scripts are subtask-generic. Change `subtask` in `configs/subtask_training.json`, or pass `SUBTASK=...` at runtime.

The training environment is pinned to LeRobot `0.6.0` with the `dataset`, `training`, and `groot` extras. LeRobot `0.6.0` uses the LeRobotDataset codebase tag `v3.0` on Hugging Face datasets and integrates GR00T N1.7 through `--policy.type=groot`.

## Dataset Source

Shared LeRobotDataset v3 repos:

```text
Team-RAMEN/IROS2026_RAMEN_suzuki_{subtask}_1
```

These repos are split from `BitRobot/G1_WBT_Dex1_Building-Children-Table`
without renaming cameras or concatenating state/action. They preserve the
official BitRobot LeRobot v3 schema so the same datasets can be reused by other
models. This training folder materializes a local model-facing view immediately
before training.

Supported subtasks:

```text
move_to_work_pose
pick_leg
coarse_insert
final_insert_contact
tighten
rotate_table_base
recover_or_regrasp
flip_table
```

## Interface

The uploaded shared datasets use the official source keys:

- FPS: `30`
- RGB videos: `observation.images.cam_0`, `cam_1`, `cam_2`, `cam_3`
- IR videos: `observation.images.cam_0_ir` ... `cam_3_ir`
- State keys: `observation.state.ee_state` [12],
  `observation.state.robot_q_current` [36], `observation.state.hand_state` [2]
- Action keys: `action.ee_action` [12], `action.robot_q_desired` [36],
  `action.hand_cmd` [2]

Training uses a local view with the standard 3-camera policy layout:

```text
observation.images.head_left   <- observation.images.cam_0
observation.images.left_wrist  <- observation.images.cam_2
observation.images.right_wrist <- observation.images.cam_3
```

`cam_0` is the head stereo left eye according to `docs/dataset/dataset.md` and
`docs/inference/vit_phase1.md`. `cam_1` is the head right eye and is ignored for
the standard policy input. IR videos are also ignored for policy training.

For ACT and Diffusion Policy, the local view materializes an upper-body-only
non-walking policy interface:

- `observation.state`: 19-D upper-body robot configuration state.
- `action`: 16-D arm/Dex1 absolute target. Waist is observed, never commanded.

State order:

```text
0..2    waist_yaw/roll/pitch
3..9    left shoulder/elbow/wrist joints
10..16  right shoulder/elbow/wrist joints
17      left_gripper_q
18      right_gripper_q
```

The dataset Dex1 scalar convention is `0.0=closed` and `4.5=open` for both
state and action. Simulator and real-robot adapters must preserve this polarity
when converting to prismatic-joint positions or normalized actuator commands.

Action order:

```text
0..6    left shoulder/elbow/wrist targets
7..13   right shoulder/elbow/wrist targets
14      left_gripper_q_cmd
15      right_gripper_q_cmd
```

Root pose and lower-body joints are deliberately dropped for ACT/Diffusion
training. During execution the policy should not command walking or leg joints;
the G1 lower-body/balance controller remains responsible for standing.

The action is an absolute upper-body target in the dataset. If a residual
action-chunk baseline is used, convert to residuals in the training adapter and
add the residual back to the current state/action reference at inference time.

`robot_q_current` and `robot_q_desired` follow the BitRobot LeRobot convention:
the first 7 values are root pose `(x,y,z,w,x,y,z)`, and the remaining 29 values
are robot joint positions/targets. The two gripper values are stored separately.

The two EEF fields are left pose followed by right pose. Each pose is
`[x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw]` in the root-link frame, with Euler XYZ angles in
radians. The dataset card identifies these as root-to-EEF FK poses; the mapping
also rejects any config that does not declare this exact convention.

For GR00T N1.7, the local view uses the base checkpoint's official
`real_g1_relative_eef_relative_joints` contract:

```text
state  49D: left EEF 9, right EEF 9, left hand 7, right hand 7,
            left arm 7, right arm 7, waist 3
action 53D: the same groups, then base height 1 and navigation 3
```

Source EEF Euler poses are converted to absolute `XYZ_ROT6D` using the first
two rows of the rotation matrix. Source arm and waist targets remain absolute
in the materialized parquet. During training, after LeRobot has assembled the
complete action chunk, the GR00T processor applies the checkpoint contract:

- EEF: `T_relative = inverse(T_current) @ T_target` for every future target,
  always anchored to the chunk's current observation.
- Arms: `q_target - q_current` for every future target.
- Hands and waist: absolute targets.
- Base-height and navigation: zero because this non-walking dataset has no such
  commands. No leg or root-pose slots are exposed to the policy.

Each Dex1-1 open/close scalar is mapped onto a fixed seven-joint G1 hand
synergy. The open/closed endpoints are robustly estimated from the pinned
official G1 data and stored in `gr00t/assets/dex1_g1_synergy.json`. Inference
projects each predicted 7-D hand vector back onto the same synergy axis with
least squares. The adapter audit requires a Dex1 round-trip error below `1e-4`
and at most 5% of mapped values outside every official q01-q99 interval; it
does not clip values to pass the audit. The shared HF dataset remains unchanged.

## Setup

Run from this directory:

```bash
./scripts/setup_env.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
hf auth login
```

Setup applies a hash-guarded compatibility patch to exactly LeRobot `0.6.0`.
Upstream 0.6.0 can decode relative EEF actions but rejects relative EEF during
training; the patch adds the same SE(3) conversion to its training processor and
refuses to modify an unknown LeRobot source version.

## Select A Subtask

Option 1: edit `configs/subtask_training.json`:

```json
{
  "subtask": "pick_leg"
}
```

Option 2: override at runtime:

```bash
SUBTASK=tighten ./scripts/train_lerobot.sh
```

To inspect the resolved training settings:

```bash
SUBTASK=pick_leg POLICY_TYPE=act \
python scripts/resolve_training_config.py --config configs/subtask_training.json --format json
```

## Train

Before training a newly generated subtask dataset, run the structural and
numerical audit. It checks source-episode provenance, contiguous indices,
timestamps, finite state/action values, camera metadata, Hub video inventory,
nearly static episodes, and writes a leakage-safe 80/10/10 split grouped by the
original recording:

```bash
python scripts/audit_lerobot_dataset.py \
  --repo-id Team-RAMEN/IROS2026_RAMEN_suzuki_flip_table_1
```

The default reports are written under `outputs/audits/`. A warning about the
missing explicit success label is expected until sampled videos have been
reviewed; it must not be interpreted as proof that all sliced demonstrations
are successful.

ACT baseline:

```bash
SUBTASK=pick_leg \
POLICY_TYPE=act \
./scripts/train_lerobot.sh
```

The ACT default is an explicit `100`-target chunk with `10` executed targets,
batch size `8`, `300000` optimizer steps, train-only image augmentation, and
offline validation every `10000` steps. Override these with the corresponding
`ACT_*` or `TRAIN_*` environment variables only after a smoke run confirms the
new memory and timing contract.

Diffusion Policy baseline:

```bash
SUBTASK=pick_leg \
POLICY_TYPE=diffusion \
./scripts/train_lerobot.sh
```

Flow Matching behavior-cloning baseline for `flip_table`:

```bash
SUBTASK=flip_table ./scripts/train_flow_matching.sh
```

This repository-native policy uses the same three-camera, 19-D state, and 16-D
arm/Dex1 absolute-target contract as ACT. The default model predicts a 24-target chunk
and executes 6 targets before replanning at the dataset's 30 Hz rate. Raw camera
frames remain 640x480 at the runtime boundary and are resized deterministically
inside the model. Training includes image augmentation, grouped train/validation
splits, periodic held-out validation, atomic checkpoints, and optional W&B
logging.

Evaluate a checkpoint only on the held-out validation or test split:

```bash
python -m model.subtask_policy_training.scripts.evaluate_flow_matching \
  --checkpoint outputs/train/flow_matching_flip_table/checkpoint_00075000 \
  --dataset-root outputs/training_views/flow_matching_flip_table \
  --split-file outputs/training_views/flow_matching_flip_table/meta/team_ramen_episode_split.json \
  --split test \
  --output outputs/evaluations/flow_matching_flip_table_test.json
```

The Flow checkpoint can be evaluated directly in simulation or used as the
frozen base policy for
`model/flip_table_reinforcement_learning/run_train_in_container.sh train_rlpd`.

GR00T N1.7 baseline through LeRobot `0.6.0`:

```bash
SUBTASK=pick_leg \
./scripts/train_groot_n17.sh
```

This uses the shared LeRobot v3 dataset (`DATASET_REPO_ID`) and materializes the
local REAL_G1 relative-EEF view before launching `lerobot-train`. The first run
downloads the pinned base model and builds a local sidecar overlay. The overlay
preserves the official 49-D state, 53-D logical action, 132-D packed tensor,
H40 action horizon, statistics, and embodiment id. The only intentional input
contract change is replacing the single official `ego_view` with head-left and
both D405 wrist views while retaining the official `[-20,0]` image history.
The wrapper injects these defaults:

```text
--policy.type=groot
--policy.base_model_path=nvidia/GR00T-N1.7-3B
base revision: 2fc962b973bccdd5d8ce4f67cc63b264d6886495
--policy.embodiment_tag=real_g1_relative_eef_relative_joints
--policy.chunk_size=40
--policy.n_action_steps=10
--policy.use_relative_actions=true
--policy.use_bf16=true
--dataset.image_transforms.enable=false
```

The H40 action horizon is fixed by the pinned base contract. Candidate
comparison starts with 10 physical steps between replans; release evaluation
selects the deployed interval and temporal decay from the validated sweep.
Training uses one coherent GPU augmentation across all two timestamps and all
three cameras in a sample; generic per-image CPU transforms stay disabled.

```bash
GROOT_N_ACTION_STEPS=10 \
./scripts/train_groot_n17.sh --steps=1000
```

`GROOT_USE_RELATIVE_ACTIONS` and
`GROOT_REQUIRE_NATIVE_RELATIVE_EEF_PROCESSOR` must remain true. The resolver
fails before training if either is disabled or if a different embodiment tag is
requested. `GROOT_RELATIVE_EXCLUDE_JOINTS` is fixed to
`["hand","waist","base_height","navigate"]`; changing it would make the
training processor and simulator decoder disagree about absolute action groups.
The valid action loss mask covers only EEF 18D, hands 14D, and arms 14D
(`0:46`). Waist, base-height, navigation, and packed padding never contribute
to the action loss. FurnitureVLA-style progress is a separate `[B,40,1]`
diagnostic head; no 54th action slot exists and progress never switches a
policy phase or generates a command.

The reproducible flip-table release run is launched as a detached process:

```bash
GROOT_PERSISTENT_RESULT_ROOT="$HOME/.cache/iros_groot_n17_transfer/results" \
GROOT_TRAINING_TARGET=baseline \
./scripts/launch_h100_flip_table_groot_n17.sh start

./scripts/launch_h100_flip_table_groot_n17.sh status
```

Run it on one H100 with at least 75 GiB VRAM and a 90 GB `/dev/shm` budget.
The launcher uses `nohup` and `setsid`, so closing the SSH connection does not
terminate training. The H100 must also contain the tmpfiles exclusion emitted
by the deployment setup for `/dev/shm/iros_2026_ramen_groot_n17`; the launcher
refuses to run without it.

Release training saves at 5,000-step intervals. Every save synchronously
uploads a complete resumable checkpoint to a separate private repository:

```text
Team-RAMEN/IROS2026_RAMEN_suzuki_flip_table_groot_n17_2_baseline_checkpoints
Team-RAMEN/IROS2026_RAMEN_suzuki_flip_table_groot_n17_2_auxiliary_checkpoints
```

These checkpoints include model weights, optimizer and scheduler state, RNG
state, processors, training configuration, and the exact training step. Each
step is tagged on the Hub (`005000`, `010000`, `015000`, `020000`) and can be
used automatically when the local tmpfs run is unavailable. W&B stores a
second, model-only artifact at the same save points. After both remote writes,
the runner keeps the latest local checkpoint generation; every older
generation remains recoverable from its immutable Hub tag. This bounds tmpfs
usage while retaining exact restart capability. The runner verifies the final
Hub file set and hashes before deleting any completed local optimizer state.
`GROOT_TRAINING_TARGET=baseline` stops after that verification;
`GROOT_TRAINING_TARGET=both` continues with the auxiliary-progress candidate.

The script pins dataset revision
`0dc47877dfb2efbea796a059c81290c649bc773c`, verifies the official N1.7
checkpoint contract and Dex1 synergy, builds the progress sidecar, and runs a
four-episode overfit gate before the release training. It then trains the
no-progress baseline and auxiliary-progress candidate with the same seed,
20,000 optimizer steps, bf16, and global batch 64. Candidate selection uses
the immutable 17-episode validation split and a same-seed five-episode
simulator comparison. Both scene randomization and flow-matching sampling use
the same per-episode seed (`base_seed + episode_index`) and the traces are
validated before selection. Offline flow-matching evaluation likewise derives
one seed from the base seed, source episode, and chunk ordinal, so model order
and previous episode duration cannot change a comparison. The selected
candidate is then evaluated once on the 18-episode test split. The remaining
139 episodes are the only full-run training episodes.

After both H100 candidates and offline validation reports are ready, the
runner exits with code 75 and writes `runs/candidate_handoff.json`. This is an
intentional release gate: copy the two candidate model directories and their
validation reports to the RTX 5090 host, then run:

```bash
bash evaluate/flip_table_simulation/run_groot_candidate_comparison.sh \
  /path/to/baseline/pretrained_model \
  /path/to/auxiliary_progress/pretrained_model \
  /path/to/eval_validation_baseline/report.json \
  /path/to/eval_validation_auxiliary_progress/report.json \
  outputs/flip_table_groot_candidate_comparison/release_candidate
```

Copy that output directory back to `runs/sim_evaluation_bundle`, and copy its
`sim_candidate_selection.json` and `sim_release_evaluation.json` to `runs/`.
Rerunning `run_h100_flip_table_groot_n17.sh` reuses both completed trainings,
verifies the simulator evidence, evaluates the selected model on test exactly
once, and continues to finalization and upload. A candidate that misses fixed
scene 3/3 or unseen-DR 40/50 is not uploaded.

The selected checkpoint is finalized with the complete release-time training,
inference, and evaluation source bundle, its capture time, per-file hashes, git
state, split, official contract audit,
EEF/FK audit, the complete progress/visual sidecars and contact-sheet approval,
lossless video-cache proof, W&B URL, and held-out metrics before private
Hugging Face upload. The same-seed candidate comparison, simulator
videos/traces, temporal sweep, fixed 3/3, and unseen-DR report are included in
the model artifact. Every fixed-scene and DR trace must carry its declared
per-episode flow-matching seed and exact DR profile. Candidate selection uses
`validation_v1`; the final gate uses the categorically disjoint
`held_out_v1` appearance/contact profile. Runtime contract verification rejects
missing, extra, modified, profile-mismatched, or seed-incomplete evidence. A
clean Hub download must reproduce the held-out report. Simulator success is not
a real-robot result.

Train another subtask by changing only `SUBTASK`:

```bash
SUBTASK=coarse_insert \
POLICY_TYPE=act \
./scripts/train_lerobot.sh
```

The defaults resolve to:

```text
DATASET_REPO_ID=Team-RAMEN/IROS2026_RAMEN_suzuki_{subtask}_1
DATASET_REVISION=  # latest revision; set a commit SHA for reproducible releases
POLICY_REPO_ID=Team-RAMEN/IROS2026_RAMEN_suzuki_{subtask}_{policy_type}_1
OUTPUT_DIR=outputs/train/{policy_type}_{subtask}
JOB_NAME={policy_type}_{subtask}
TRAINING_VIEW_ROOT=outputs/training_views/{policy_type}_{subtask}
WANDB_PROJECT=iros2026-ramen-{subtask-with-hyphens}
```

You can still override any of them explicitly:

```bash
SUBTASK=pick_leg \
POLICY_TYPE=act \
OUTPUT_DIR=outputs/train/debug_pick_leg \
POLICY_REPO_ID=Team-RAMEN/IROS2026_RAMEN_suzuki_pick_leg_act_debug \
./scripts/train_lerobot.sh --steps=1000
```

Additional arguments are passed through to `lerobot-train`.

Set `DRY_RUN=true` to print the resolved `lerobot-train` command without starting training.

By default, the wrapper keeps LeRobot's internal `--policy.push_to_hub=false` and uploads the final checkpoint after successful training with `scripts/upload_policy.py`. This avoids losing the final model when the training command was launched with hub push disabled. Set `UPLOAD_AFTER_TRAIN=false` to skip the post-training upload, or set `PUSH_TO_HUB=true` if you also want LeRobot's native hub push behavior during training.

W&B project names default to `iros2026-ramen-{subtask}` with underscores converted to hyphens, for example `iros2026-ramen-flip-table`. Override with `WANDB_PROJECT=...` if a run needs to land somewhere else.

The wrapper defaults `TOLERANCE_S=0.001` to tolerate small MP4 timestamp rounding differences during video-backed training. Override it only if a run needs stricter validation:

```bash
TOLERANCE_S=0.0001 ./scripts/train_lerobot.sh
```

## Local Training View

`scripts/train_lerobot.sh` always runs `scripts/materialize_lerobot_training_view.py`
before training. The raw official schema is not directly compatible with the
policy keys, so disabling this step is rejected. The local view is written under:

```text
outputs/training_views/{policy_type}_{subtask}
```

The source HF dataset is not rewritten. The materializer downloads only
`meta/**`, `data/**`, and the selected RGB camera videos (`cam_0`, `cam_2`,
`cam_3`), then writes:

- `data/chunk-*/file-*.parquet` with canonical LeRobot policy keys:
  `observation.state` and `action`.
- `videos/observation.images.head_left`, `left_wrist`, `right_wrist` as local
  symlinks to the selected source video directories.
- `meta/info.json`, `meta/stats.json`, and `meta/episodes/**` with renamed
  camera keys and recombined state/action stats, including `q01/q99`.
- `meta/team_ramen_episode_split.json` with a deterministic 80/10/10 split by
  original recording. Test recordings are excluded from training; LeRobot's
  offline evaluator receives only the held-out validation recordings.
- For GR00T, `meta/modality.json` with the checked 49-D/53-D group order,
  source EEF convention, and per-group relative/absolute action semantics.

The materializer validates LeRobot v3, 30 Hz, the exact three 640x480 RGB
cameras, all source vector dimensions, and finite mapped values. It fingerprints
the source metadata/parquets and builds into a temporary directory before
replacing an old view, so failed conversion cannot destroy a usable view.
State/action normalization statistics are recomputed from the training split
only; validation and test recordings do not influence those statistics.

Set `TRAINING_VIEW_FORCE=true` to rebuild an existing view, or
`SOURCE_DATASET_ROOT=/path/to/local/dataset` to materialize from an already
downloaded dataset tree.

Audit the source dataset before a release training run:

```bash
python scripts/audit_lerobot_dataset.py \
  --repo-id Team-RAMEN/IROS2026_RAMEN_suzuki_flip_table_1 \
  --revision 10a6ec05f9993b8d59faad2957e47153b0f15f37 \
  --strict
```

The audit checks metadata, all numeric columns, local video decoding, and the
exact remote MP4 inventory. A dataset without an explicit success field reports
a warning until its demonstrations have been visually reviewed; run without
`--strict` only after recording that review decision.

To compare one ACT checkpoint on real and simulator observations, supply a
captured frame directory and the matching evaluator log explicitly:

```bash
python scripts/diagnose_act_policy_outputs.py \
  --checkpoint /path/to/pretrained_model \
  --dataset-root outputs/training_views/act_flip_table \
  --sim-frame-dir /path/to/test_0/camera_frames/frame_0010 \
  --sim-log /path/to/flip_table_eval.log
```

The diagnostic uses strict model loading and the normalizer files referenced by
the serialized processor manifests. It does not substitute missing statistics.

## Upload A Policy

```bash
SUBTASK=pick_leg \
POLICY_TYPE=act \
MODEL_DIR=outputs/train/act_pick_leg/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model \
./scripts/upload_policy.sh
```

If `MODEL_DIR` is omitted, it defaults to:

```text
outputs/train/{policy_type}_{subtask}/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model
```

The upload wrapper uses the Python Hugging Face Hub API, creates the private
model repo if needed, and validates both the core LeRobot files and every
processor state file referenced by the serialized processors. Files left by an
older checkpoint are deleted from the model repo, while `README.md` and
`.gitattributes` are preserved.

The training wrapper calls the same uploader automatically after a successful run. It resolves `outputs/train/{policy_type}_{subtask}/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model` first, then falls back to the newest numbered checkpoint.

## Download Raw Source MCAPs

This is usually unnecessary for training because the converted HF datasets are already uploaded. For debugging source data:

```bash
SUBTASK=pick_leg \
python scripts/download_source_mcaps.py \
  --config configs/subtask_training.json \
  --max-mcaps 3
```

Dataset conversion is intentionally kept out of this training folder. Production
subtask datasets are created by `data/bitrobot_lerobot_subtask_datasets`, which
splits the official BitRobot LeRobot v3 dataset by subtask and uploads the
shared HF repos without model-specific key rewriting. Model-specific layout is
handled locally by the training view materializer.

`scripts/write_groot_modality_json.py` can regenerate only the checked modality
metadata for diagnostics. New and existing training runs must use
`scripts/train_lerobot.sh`; the obsolete 43-D/47-D standalone GR00T
materializer has been removed to prevent accidental use.
